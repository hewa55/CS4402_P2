# LogicSolver
This logic solver in Java provides multiple ways to traverse a solution tree. MAC and FordwardChecking algorithms are based on binary search trees.

# FordwardChecker
The FordwardChecker in this implementation uses assingments to prune the future search trees.

# MAC
MAC is an advanced pruning algorithm for clearing binary search trees. This implementaction uses MAC3, with space and time complexity as commonly reported in literature.

# Input
The input is done in the csp file format.
The first line indicated the number of variables, followed by the domains of the variables.
The next lines stated the contraints explicitly.
See the csp files given to understand the format.
